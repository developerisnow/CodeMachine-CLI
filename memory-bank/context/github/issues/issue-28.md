Hi, after adding OpenCode and CCR, we do have additional engines on our roadmap, but they’re not scheduled in the near term. In the meantime, we’re open to community contributions for new engines. You can review the existing PRs, contributors have been actively adding engines, and we’ve created a simple Notion guide to help contributors implement their own. When reviewing past PRs and the subsequent improvements, you’ll see common pitfalls, mostly related to overriding the home directory, authentication, and logging.
