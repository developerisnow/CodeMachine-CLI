## Description

Hello,  

First, I'd like to express my appreciation for the excellent work you’ve done with CodeMachine-CLI! It has been a fantastic tool, and I deeply value the functionality you’ve implemented so far.  

I’d like to suggest adding support for the recently released Devstral 2 Vibe CLI by Mistral. As highlighted in their announcement (https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli), the Vibe CLI offers state-of-the-art capabilities, and its integration into CodeMachine-CLI could significantly enhance its value for developers.  

Specific benefits of integrating this feature could include:  

1. Seamless access to cutting-edge tools and workflows provided by the Vibe CLI.  
2. Leveraging lightweight operations and advanced functionalities that align with modern development needs.  
3. Expanding the scope of CodeMachine-CLI and attracting a wider community of users who rely on Vibe CLI in their processes.  

Please let me know if I can assist in any way by providing more details or participating in testing should you consider this integration.  

Thank you for considering this feature request, and keep up the amazing work!
