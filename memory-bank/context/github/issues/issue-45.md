## Description

I use the pay-as-you-go version of claude code on console.anthropic.com, meaning that I don't actually have an account on claude.ai, which is blocking me from being able to configure Code Machine to be able to use my functioning installation of claude code.

Thank you for reporting this! We’ll prioritize this for the next release by passing the terminal environment through to our engines inside CodeMachine.

For the time being, I was able to get it to work with Claude Code Router using my API key.
