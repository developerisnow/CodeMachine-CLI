CodeMachine's current workflow is overpowered for Pine Script development. It's optimized for large-scale projects with hundreds of files. However, if you're proficient in Pine Script, you can design a custom workflow to generate high-quality Pine Scripts tailored to your needs. this will require you to craft your own prompts and configure the workflow accordingly.
